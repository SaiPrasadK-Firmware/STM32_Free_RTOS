## Topics Overview

| Topic                        | Project                             | Learning Outcome                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Management**          | `01_Task_Creation_Basics`           | Create tasks using `osThreadNew()` and blink LEDs         |
|                              | `02_Task_Delay_and_Timing`          | Use `osDelay()` and tick counts for periodic execution    |
|                              | `03_Task_Delete_and_Lifecycle`      | Learn dynamic task deletion with `osThreadTerminate()`    |
| **Mutex**                    | `04_Mutex_UARTLogging`              | Protect shared resources for safe communication           |
| **Semaphores**               | `05_BinarySemaphore_ButtonLED`      | Use binary semaphores for synchronization with interrupts |
|                              | `06_CountingSemaphore_ResourceMgmt` | Manage limited resources between tasks                    |
| **Inter-task Communication** | `07_Queue_Producer_Consumer`        | Safe data transfer between tasks using queues             |
|                              | `08_MessageBuffer_UART`             | Stream data using message buffers                         |
|                              | `09_EventGroups_MultiConditionSync` | Multi-condition task synchronization using event groups   |
| **Final Integration**        | `10_MultiTask_CompleteSystem`       | Combine all concepts into one complete STM32 system       |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* STM32CubeIDE (or equivalent IDE)
* STM32 development board
* Basic knowledge of C programming
* FreeRTOS library

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/STM32-FreeRTOS.git
cd STM32-FreeRTOS
```

Open desired project folder in STM32CubeIDE â†’ Build â†’ Flash to your STM32 board.

---

## Usage

Each topic folder contains:

* Source code
* README.md with specific setup and steps
* Example results

Open the relevant folder, follow the instructions in that folderâ€™s README, and run the project.
